This project is about creating a registration form using HTML. A registration form allows users to enter their personal details and sign up for a service, website, or application. The form typically includes input fields such as Name, Email, Phone Number, Password, and Confirm Password, along with options like gender selection, date of birth, and address.

The main objective of this project is to collect user information in a structured format. Using HTML, we can design the form layout with labels and input fields, while CSS can be used to style the form, making it more attractive and user-friendly. Additionally, input attributes like required, type="email", type="password", and pattern can be used for basic form validation to ensure correct data entry.
